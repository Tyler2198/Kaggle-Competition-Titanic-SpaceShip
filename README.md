# Passenger Survival Prediction on SpaceTitanic 🚀
This project aims to predict passenger survival (Transported) aboard the fictional SpaceTitanic spaceship using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and preparation of submission results.

## Project Overview 📊
This project uses data from a hypothetical competition where participants predict the survival of passengers based on various features. The main objectives include:

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Feature engineering to create new informative variables.
- Building a robust machine learning pipeline using XGBoost.
- Evaluating the model performance with metrics like accuracy and classification reports.

## Dependencies 🛠️
To run this notebook, you need the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost
- sklearn
